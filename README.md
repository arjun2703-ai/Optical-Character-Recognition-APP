# Optical-Character-Recognition-APP
An Optical Character Recognition (OCR) app is a software application that utilizes advanced algorithms and technology to convert printed or handwritten text into editable and searchable digital content.


Key features and functionalities commonly found in an OCR app include:

Image Text Extraction: The app captures text from images, scans, or photographs, transforming the visual data into machine-readable text.

Text Editing: Users can edit and manipulate the extracted text just like any other digital content. This includes copying, pasting, formatting, and modifying the text.

Searchability: Once the text is extracted, it becomes searchable, allowing users to quickly locate specific information within a large body of text.
